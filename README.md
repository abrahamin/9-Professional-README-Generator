# 9-Professional-README-Generator

  ## Description

  It is important to have a high-quality README for any open source project on GitHub. The README should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. As an open source project, the ability to efficiently incorporate contributions is key to the overall success of the project. The purpose of this project was to create a command-line application that can easily generate a README file. The README will be dynamically generated using the user's input via the Inquirer package.
  
  In order to meet the Acceptance Criteria of the project:

  * the generated README will contain a title and sections labelled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
  * the input for the title, description, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions will become the contents of the corresponding sections in the generated README
  * choosing a license for the application from a list of options will generate a badge for that license near the top of the generated README
  * the input for GitHub username and email will be added to the section regarding Questions, including instructions on how to contact the user
  * clicking the links in the Table of Contents will bring the user to the corresponding section of the generated README
